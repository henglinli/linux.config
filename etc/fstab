# noatime turns off atimes for increased performance (atimes normally aren't
# needed; notail increases performance of ReiserFS (at the expense of storage
# efficiency). It's safe to drop the noatime options if you want and to
# switch between notail / tail freely.

# The root filesystem should have a pass number of either 0 or 1.
# All other filesystems should have a pass number of 0 or greater than 1.
#
# Use /dev/<UUID> for device nodes. To find the UUIDs, use e. g.:
# blkid
# The above command will give you all information you need. Or you use
# blkid /dev/<something>
# to get the UUID for a specific device node.
#
# See the manpage fstab(5) for more information.
